# Number guessing game

This game will randomly select a number from 1-10 and the user will have to guess that number chosen. 
The attempts taken will be recorded and a scoreboard is shown. (The lower the score the better)

On the second iteration of the game, if the random number chosen is the same number, the game will randomly choose another number.
